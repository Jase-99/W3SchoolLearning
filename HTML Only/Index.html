        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm keen to promote healthier lifestyles, in creating different technologies to innovate the way users see
            fitness. When
            I was young I enjoyed seeing how things worked, this lead to my interest in IT, as years went on I gained an
            interest in
            health and fitness. Motivated to change the way everyday people see fitness I wanted to further study IT and
            learn how I
            can make a difference. Throughout my degree I have been able to work in teams which further developed my
            leadership
            skills as well as my time management skills.</p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
            My programming journey began in my later years while I was at Swinburne University, where I found a passion,
            being in my
            final year of my degree it didn't make sense to switch majors so I completed my networking technology major
            and decided
            to go the self taught route for web development with the foundational skills taught by Swinburne.
        </p>
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>One of my other passions is Photography, love to get outside and take photos, lately I've been trying my hand
            in
            videography which presents its own set of challenges. I enjoy taking photos of nature and aim to explore
            many countries
            taking photos along the way.</p>
